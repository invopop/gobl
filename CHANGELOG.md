## [v0.72.0] - 2024-04-18

Refactoring region handling for Portugal VAT and now supporting `-` in `cbc.Code`.

### Added

- Regimes: Extensions can now be used to match tax rates.
- Tax: Extensions helper methods: `Merge` and `Contains`.
- MX: stamps for `cfdi`, `sat`, `sat-chain`, `sat-url`.

### Changed

- `cbc.Code`: Now supports `-` symbol alongside `.` as a separator. Mixed feelings on this as we wanted to avoid normalization complications, but it became clear with the PT changes that a bit more flexibility here is useful. (Side note: the original intent of `cbc.Code` was to avoid dashes in tax IDs, but these are now normalized automatically.)
- PT: moving from tax tags `azores` and `madeira` to `pt-region` extension provided in taxes combo for each line.
- PT: auto-migrate invoice supplier tax ID zone to appropriate line tax combo extension.

### Fixed

- none

## [v0.71.0] - 2024-04-08

- `currency` provides "definitions" loaded from JSON with support for formatting.
- Polish (PL) correction and preceding validation.
- Polish (PL) header stamps for QR code.

### Changed
