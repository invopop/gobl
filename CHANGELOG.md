## [v0.211.0] - 2025-02-28

Another significant release that adds more documents related to the order-to-payment billing flows, and renames the "Receipt" document to simply "Payment". There are now 4 primary billing documents:

- Order
- Delivery
- Invoice
- Payment (renamed from Receipt)

Each document class has a subset of types to cover multiple situations. Its been tough, but we've tried to keep naming as simple and down to earth as possible so that every combination of document class and type should be easy to understand.

- `bill`: `PaymentLine` `tax` property moved to the `document`.

### Fixed

- `pay`: `Terms`, replaced `NA` option with explicit `undefined` key, to avoid defining empty constants in JSON.

### Fixed

- `pt`: moving invoice tags from saft addon to regime, ensure defaults present.

## [v0.200.0] - 2024-09-26

Another ~~significant~~ epic release. Introducing "add-ons" which move the normalization and validation rules from Tax Regimes to specific packages that need to be enabled inside a document to be used.

Tax Regimes are now also defined using the `$regime` keyword at the top of the document under the `$schema` and alongside `$addons` and `$tags`. This is a significant move with the aim of making the core GOBL project as flexible as possible, while allowing greater levels of validation and customization to be added as needed.

Another very significant internal change is around normalization. There is now a much clearer difference internally between `Calculate` and `Normalize` methods. Calculate methods are used when there is some type of math operation to perform, and normalize will simply clean the data as much as possible. The three key steps in order are: normalize, calculate, and validate.

Finally, the `draft` flag has been removed from the header, and much more emphasis has been placed on the signatures for validation. For example, the invoice's "code" property will only be required in order to sign the envelope.

(We've made a big jump in minor version numbers to clarify the extent of the changes.)

### Changed

- `head.Header`: Removed the `draft` flag. Instead envelopes must now be signed in order to activate additional validation rules such as requiring the invoice code, and allow "stamps" in the header.
- Renamed `Calculate` methods to `Normalize` and removed errors, to clearly differentiate between the two processes.
- `bill`: Moved tax `tags` to the invoice level `$tags` property.
- `tax`: Renamed `Regime` to `RegimeDef`.
- `tax`: Renamed `Category` to `CategoryDef`.
- `tax`: Renamed `Rate` to `RateDef`.
- `tax`: Renamed `RateValue` to `RateValueDef`.
- `mx`: local normalization, validation, and extensions moved to the `addons/mx/cfdi` package to use with the `mx-cfdi-v4` key.
- `es`: moved FacturaE and TicketBAI extensions to the `addons/es/facturae` and `addons/es/tbai` packages respecitvely.
- `pt`: moved SAF-T specific extensions to `addons/pt/saft`.

## [v0.115.1] - 2024-09-10

### Fixes

- `tax`: totals calculator was ignoring tax combos with rate and percent, when they should be classed as exempt.

## [v0.115.0] - 2024-09-10

This one is big...

Significant set of changes around Scenario handling. Scenarios defined by tax regimes can now set tax extensions at the document level automatically. The objective here is to move away from external projects using scenario summaries directly, and instead use the absolute values set in the document.

For example, the document format and type in Italy are now set inside the extensions and can be overriden if needed manually. This will be especially important when receiving and converting invoices into GOBL from external formats; its much easier to set specific values than trying to determine the appropriate tags.

Also included is support for defining the country in tax combos, making it possible for taxes from a customers country to applied directly if needed. Typical use case would be for selling digital goods into or between EU states for B2C customers.

Invoices in GOBL can now also finally produced for any country in the world, even if not explicitly defined inside the tax regimes.

### Changed

- `bill.Invoice`: `customer` can now be empty by default, the `simplified` simplified tag will have no effect on the document unless used by regime scenarios.
- `bill.Invoice`: using the `customer-rates` tag will now automatically copy the customer's country code, if available, to the individual tax combo lines.
- `tax`: moved `NormalizeIdentity` method from the regimes common package so that it can be applied to all tax IDs, regardless of if they have a regime defined or not.
- `pt`: VAT rate key is now optional if `pt-saft-tax-rate` is provided.
- `gr`: simplified validation to use tax categories.
- `it`: always add `it-sdi-fiscal-regime` to Invoice suppliers.
- `it`: renamed extension `it-sdi-retained-tax` to `it-sdi-retained`, now with validation on retained taxes.
- `it`: renamed extension `it-sdi-natura` to `it-sdi-exempt`.
- `bill.Invoice`: deprecated the `ScenarioSummary` method, as tax regimes themselves should be using extensions to apply all the correct data to a document up front.
- `mx`: scenarios will now copy the document and relation types to the tax extensions.
- `cbc`: consolidated "keys" and "codes" lists from key definitions into a single values array.
- `gr`: switched to use the new `round-then-sum` calculation method
- `tax.Combo`: rates when defined will always update the combo.
- `bill.Invoice`: tax tags will always cause scenarios to update the document.
- `es`: support for `facturae` tag which will correct set local extensions instead of using scenario summary codes.

### Added

- `tax`: `Combo` now supports a `country` field.
- `tax.Category`: added `Validation` method support for custom validation of a tax combo for a specific tax category.
- `tax.Scenario`: added "extensions" to be able to automatically update document level extensions based on the scenario detected.
- `it`: added `ExtKeySDIDocumentType` as an extension that will be automatically included according to the scenario.
- `it`: now adding `ExtKeySDIFormat` value to document instead of just referencing from scenarios.
- `cbc.Note`: now provides `SameAs` method that will compare key attributes, but not the text payload. This is now used in Schema Summaries.
- `bill.Line`: added `RequireLineTaxCategory` validation helper method.
- `cbc`: added new `ValueDefinition`.
- `gr`: added "Income Classification" extensions.
- `tax.TotalCalculator`: now supports `round-then-sum` as an alternative to the default `sum-then-round` calculation method to meet the requirements of regimes like Greece.

### Removed

- `tax.Category`: removed `RateRequired` flag, regimes should instead should help users determine valid extensions (eg. PT and GR).
- `cbc`: removed `CodeDefinition`.

### Fixed

- `tax.Scenario`: potential issue around matching notes.
- `tax.Set`: improved validation embedded error handling.

## [v0.114.0] - 2024-08-26

### Changed

- `org.Name`: either given **or** surname are required, as opposed to both at the same time.

## [v0.113.0] - 2024-08-01

### Added

- `head`: validation rule to check for the presence of stamps
- GR: support for credit notes

## [v0.112.0] - 2024-07-29

Significant set of small changes related to renaming of the `l10n.CountryCode` type. The main reason for this is an attempt to reduce confusion between regular ISO country selection, and the specific country codes used for tax purposes. Normally they coincide, but exception cases like for Greece, whose ISO code is `GR` but use `EL` for tax purposes, or `XI` for companies in Northern Ireland, mean that there needs to be a clear selection.

### Changed

- CO: improved regime's documentation
- `l10n`: split "CountryCode" into "ISOCountryCode" and "TaxCountryCode", for the two explicit use-cases.
- `l10n`: renamed `CountryDefinitions` variable to `Countries()` method.

### Added

- Code coverage report (still a lot to improve there!)
- GR: support for simplified invoices
- `l10n`: ISO and Tax lists of country definitions available, e.g. `l10n.Countries().ISO()`
- `tax`: support for alternative country codes
- `tax`: Scenarios now handle extension key and value for filtering.
- PT: exemption text handling moved to scenarios.

### Fixed

- IT: Company fiscal code can be the same as the VAT code.

### Added

- `bill.Invoice`: experimental `ConvertInto` method to convert the invoice's amounts from one currency into another.
- DE: support for "de-tax-number" identity which can be used instead of regular tax ID code inside Germany.
- DE: "simplified" tax tag removes requirement for supplier tax identification.

## [v0.81.0] - 2024-07-17

### Added

- `tax.Regime`: added new "Identity Keys" definition.
- IT: `it-sdi-format` extension added with the two main document formats in Italy: `FPA12` and `FPR12` (default for B2B/C if none assigned).

### Changed

- `tax.Regime`: standardised naming around key definitions to always include `_keys` as suffix.
- IT: moved fiscal code (codice fiscale) from the `org.Party` Tax ID to the Identities array with the specific key `it-fiscal-code`. This implies that invoices can now be issued with **both** a VAT code (partita IVA) and a fiscal code (codice fiscale).
- IT: data will be normalized automatically to move the fiscal code from the tax ID to the identities array.
- IT: removed explicit support for Tax ID type field.

## [v0.80.0] - 2024-06-27

### Added

- `num.Amount` - `RescaleDown` method, that helps reduce accuracy from a number if higher.
- `num.Amount` - `RescaleRange` method, ensures that the exponent is within a specific range.
- Greece tax regime
- `tax.Combo` - regime specific calculations now supported.

## [v0.79.3] - 2024-06-18

## [v0.77.0] - 2024-05-16

Fixing important bugs with some tax regimes and tax identity code validation, along with a new 'series' property for correction options.

### Added

- `series` property added to bill Correction Options to allow a series for a credit note to be added.
- `label` property added to `org.Party`.

### Changed

- Invoice Discounts and Charges will no longer update the `base` property according to the document's sum.
- Exempt rate in `tax.Combo` no longer required when percent is empty.
- When correcting an invoice, if no new series is provided, the previous document's series will be maintained.

### Fixed

- Precision handling of calculated invoice discounts and charges.

## [v0.76.0] - 2024-05-13

Finally, invoice multi-currency support! It's been a very long time coming, but we've finalized the details on how to handle currency conversion in invoices and potentially other documents.

### Added

- Invoice Line Item alternative pricing added to be able to define custom prices in different currencies: `line.AltPrices`
- Automatic conversion of invoice line item prices into invoice currency based on exchange rates defined in invoice if no alternative prices provided.
- If an invoice has a currency that is different from that of the tax regime, a validation rule ensures that an exchange rate is defined.
- `currency.Amount` - new model that combines a currency with an amount.
- BE: added Belgium regime.

### Changed

- _BREAKING_: refactor of `currency.ExchangeRate` to clearly define `from` and `to` currencies (this was never supported, so we're not expecting anything to actually break).
- Removed all regime specific currency validation, this is now performed by the invoice and depends on the available exchange rates.
- MX: invoice line totals validated to be **zero** or more, instead of positive.

### Fixed

- Removing code requirement from Tax ID validation in all regimes so that when issuing a document to another country, the customers tax ID code will be validated if present, but will **not** be required. Any local rules for the issuing country for foreign IDs will continue to be applied.

## [v0.75.1] - 2024-05-07

### Change

- MX: allow line taxes to be empty.

## [v0.75.0] - 2024-05-06

### Added

- Bill Invoice Tax objects now support tax extensions.
- MX Stamps for signatures from CFDI and SAT.
- MX: extension for Place of Issue code: `mx-cfdi-issue-place` that replaces previous post code option in the supplier. Automatic normalization added.
- `head` package now has `GetStamp` method to find a stamp by its provider from an array.
- `num.Percentage` has `Base()` method to access base amount.
- MX: FuelAccountBalance complement now supports `percent` as an alternative to `rate`.
- ES: added extra TicketBAI exemption reasons
- Envelope `Replicate()` and supporting methods to be able to clone/replicate an envelope or document without any potentially conflicting data.

### Changed

- `reverse-charge` tag will no longer have impact on tax calculations, each tax combo per line should define if taxes are exempt or not.
- Renaming `mx.StampProviderSATUUID` constant to just `mx.StampSATUUID`.
- MX: FuelAccountBalance complement renamed tax `code` to `cat` (Category) with explicit usage of regular tax codes to be more aligned with other usage of tax categories.

### Fixed

- UUID `IsNotZero` will not raise error for empty UUIDs.

## [v0.74.1] - 2024-05-23

UUID Unmarshal fix.

### Fixed

- UUID: parsing empty strings from JSON no longer causes error.

## [v0.74.0] - 2024-05-23

Refining UUID library and moving to using version 7 as the default in GOBL.

### Added

- Additional UUID validation rules: `Valid`, `IsV6`, `Isv7`, `HasTimestamp`, and `Timeless`.

### Changed

- Using Version 7 UUIDs as default in GOBL. This version enables ordering by UUID and uses random extra data instead of a node ID.

### Fixed

- Parsing empty UUIDs now returns an empty UUID instead of an error.

## [v0.73.0] - 2024-04-22

Refactoring UUID support.

**IMPORTANT:** When running `Calculate()`, a uuid will now be assigned automatically to the document embedded in an Envelope if not already set. This is important to ensure that links between documents can always be maintained, no matter the source.

### Added

- Schema Object: `Calculate()` will now inject UUIDs.
- Schema Object: `UUID()` method will provide the UUID of the underlying document.
- `schema.Identifiable` interface to be able to read and set UUIDs on documents.
- `uuid.Identify` that makes it easier to embed UUIDs into documents with helper methods.

### Changed

- UUID: refactored to use underlying string type instead of external package. This makes it easier to manage empty values, and avoids usage of pointers.
- Removed all pointers to UUIDs and many cases replaced with `uuid.Identify` embedded structure.

### Fixed

- none

## [v0.72.0] - 2024-04-18

Refactoring region handling for Portugal VAT and now supporting `-` in `cbc.Code`.

### Added

- Regimes: Extensions can now be used to match tax rates.
- Tax: Extensions helper methods: `Merge` and `Contains`.

### Changed

- `cbc.Code`: Now supports `-` symbol alongside `.` as a separator. Mixed feelings on this as we wanted to avoid normalization complications, but it became clear with the PT changes that a bit more flexibility here is useful. (Side note: the original intent of `cbc.Code` was to avoid dashes in tax IDs, but these are now normalized automatically.)
- PT: moving from tax tags `azores` and `madeira` to `pt-region` extension provided in taxes combo for each line.
- PT: auto-migrate invoice supplier tax ID zone to appropriate line tax combo extension.

### Fixed

- none

## [v0.71.0] - 2024-04-08

- `num` package now provides advanced number formatting.
- `currency` provides "definitions" loaded from JSON with support for formatting.
- Polish (PL) correction and preceding validation.
- Polish (PL) header stamps for QR code.

### Changed

- `num` package refactored so that `num.Percentage` is independent from `num.Amount`.

### Fixed

- Minor fixes around tax regime definitions.
- [invopop/yaml](https://github.com/invopop/yaml) upgraded.

## [v0.70.1] - 2024-03-25

- Last version before CHANGELOG.md.
