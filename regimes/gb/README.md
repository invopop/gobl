## Tax Identity

UK VAT Registration Numbers (VRN) are 9 digits, optionally prefixed with "GB". Special formats exist for government departments (`GD000`–`GD499`) and health authorities (`HA500`–`HA999`).

Standard commercial numbers are validated using a modulus 97 checksum algorithm (with both old and new series supported).
