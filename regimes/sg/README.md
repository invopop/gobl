## Overview of GST

Singapore offers a simple GST model with a standard rate along with a few exceptions. It also offers a few methods for invoicing which will be described further down. GST is handled by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore ([IRAS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)))

For GST to be chargeable on a supply of goods and services, the following four conditions must be satisfied:

1. The supply must be made in Singapore
2. The supply is a taxable supply
3. The supply is made by a taxable person
4. The supply is made in the course of furhtherance of any business carried on by the taxable person, i.e, GST is not chargeable on personal transactions

GST is chargeable on all imported goods (whether for domestic consumption, sale, or re-export), regardless of whether the importer is GST-registered or not. The importer is required to take up the appropriate import permit and pay GST upon importation of the goods into Singapore. Import GST is not chargeable under the following circumstances:

1. Importation of investment precious metals
2. Importation of goods that are specifically given GST reliefs5 under the GST
Act
3. Importation of goods into Zero-GST/Licensed warehouses administered by
Singapore Customs 
4. Importation of goods by GST-registered businesses that are under Major
Exporter Scheme or other approved schemes.

## Rates

1. Standard rate of **9%**. (Since 01/01/2024)
2. Zero-rate which applies to international services and export of goods.
3. Exempt Supplies which include financial services, sale and lease of residential properties, digital payment tokens, and the import of investment precious metals.
4. Out-of-scope supplies refer to supplies which are outside the scope of the GST
Act. Some examples are salaries paid to employees for their services or supplies where the place of supply is outside of Singapore.

*Other tax rates such as 50% discount on selling price for second hand goods are not covered yet*

## Invoicing methods

There are three main methods for invoicing which will be described below. Other methods like credit notes and reverse billing have to follow the structure of a normal Tax Invoice.

### Tax Invoice

A tax invoice need not be issued for the making of zero-rated supplies, exempt
supplies, deemed supplies or to non-GST registered customers. However, if
you choose to issue a tax invoice for your zero-rated supplies, you need to
indicate all the information that is required on a tax invoice and that GST is
charged at 0%. 

A tax invoice must not be issued if:
- You are not registered for GST
- You are selling goods using the Gross Margin Scheme (GMS)
- You are the supplier in a self-billing arrangement where your customer
issues the tax invoice


This invoice, reference in GOBL by the use of the tax tag "standard" represents a basic Invoice. This Invoice has to meet certain requirements:

1. The words ‚Äútax invoice‚Äù in a prominent place.
2. An identifying number (e.g. invoice number).
3. Date of issue of the invoice.
4. Supplier business name, address and GST registration number.
5. Customer‚Äôs name and address.
6. A description sufficient to identify the goods or services supplied and the type of supply.
7. For each description of goods or services supplied, the quantity of goods or the extent of services, and the amount payable, excluding GST.
8. Any cash discount offered.
9. The total amount payable (excluding GST), the GST rate and the total amount of GST chargeable.
10. The total amount payable (including the total amount of GSTchargeable).
11. A breakdown of exempt, zero-rated or other supplies, stating separatelythe gross total amount payable in respect of each type of supply.

### Simplified Tax Invoice

This invoice is referenced by the tax tag "simplified". This invoice can only be used when the total amount (inclusive of GST) is less than 1000 SGD. This invoice has less requirements:

1. Suplier name, address and GST registration number;
2. An identifying number, e.g. invoice number.
3. The date of issue of the invoice.
4. Description of the goods or services supplied.
5. The total amount payable including tax.
6. The word ‚ÄúPrice Payable includes GST‚Äù.

### Receipt

This type of invoice can be issued to a non-GST registered costumer. A receipt must be serially printed and must show the following:

1. Suplier name and GST registration number;
2. The date of issue of the invoice.
3. The total amount payable including tax.
4. The word ‚ÄúPrice Payable includes GST‚Äù.

We will use a new tag "receipt", as some validations are different. For instance, the address of the supplier is not needed for receipts but yes for tax invoices.

### Credit Note
A credit note is issued to correct a mistake or to give a credit to your customer. A credit note must include:

1. An identifying number e.g. a serial number
2. Date of issue
3. Your name, address and GST registration number
4. Your customer's name and address
5. Reason for the credit, e.g. "returned goods"
6. Detailed description to identify the goods and services that credit is allowed for
7. Quantity and amount credited for each description
8. Total amount credited, excluding tax
9. Rate and amount of tax credited
10. Total amount credited, including tax
11. Number and date of the original tax invoice

### Debit Note
You should only issue a debit note to request for payment for transactions where no GST is charged (e.g. internal billings within the same company), or to suppliers from whom credit is due. **Not used for correcting an invoice**

### Self-billing
Self-billing is a billing arrangement between a GST-registered supplier and a GST-registered customer, where the customer, instead of the supplier, prepares the supplier's tax invoice/ customer accounting tax invoice and sends a copy to the supplier.

## Singapore tax IDs
Suppliers in Singapore may use several official tax identification numbers on invoices, depending on their entity type and tax status:

- **Unique Entity Number (UEN)**: All registered business entities in Singapore, not specific to GST. Every GST-registered business has a UEN, but UEN itself is the company‚Äôs main ID, not a GST number. 
- **GST Registration number**: Any business entity that is registered for GST with IRAS. Overseas suppliers who register for GST also receive one. GST-registered suppliers are required to print their GST Registration Number on every tax invoice and receipt issued.

This means that if a company is GST registered, the invoice must include both numbers. When issuing an invoice to a Singaporean company, you would only need to include the UEN of that company. Therefore, in GOBL, the UEN will be included as tax id and GST registration number as an identity. 

There exist other tax IDs in Singapore like the NRIC or FIN, but they are used mainly for personal identification, and not mandated on invoices.

## Schemes
In Singapore there are some schemes that allow reduced rates:

- **Discounted Sale Price Scheme**: When you sell a second-hand or used vehicle using this scheme, you can charge GST on 50% of the selling price.
- **Gross Margin Scheme**: GST is accounted for on the gross margin (i.e. selling price less purchase price) instead of full value of the goods supplied.
