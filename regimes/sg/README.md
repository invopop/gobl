# üá∏üá¨ GOBL Singapore Tax Regime

This document provides an overview of the tax regime in Singapore

Find example SG GOBL files in the [`examples`](../../examples/sg) (uncalculated documents) and [`examples/out`](../../examples/sg/out) (calculated envelopes) subdirectories.

## Rates

1. Standard rate of **9%**. (Since 01/01/2024)
2. Zero-rate which applies to international services and export of goods.
3. Exempt Supplies which include financial services, sale and lease of residential properties, digital payment tokens, and the import of investment precious metals.
4. Out-of-scope supplies refer to supplies which are outside the scope of the GST Act. Some examples are salaries paid to employees for their services or supplies where the place of supply is outside of Singapore.

In Singapore there are some schemes that allow reduced rates:

- **Discounted Sale Price Scheme**: When you sell a second-hand or used vehicle using this scheme, you can charge GST on 50% of the selling price.
- **Gross Margin Scheme**: GST is accounted for on the gross margin (i.e. selling price less purchase price) instead of full value of the goods supplied.

*We are not considering these for now*

### Debit Note
You should only issue a debit note to request for payment for transactions where no GST is charged (e.g. internal billings within the same company), or to suppliers from whom credit is due. **Not used for correcting an invoice**

## Singapore tax IDs
Suppliers in Singapore may use several official tax identification numbers on invoices, depending on their entity type and tax status:

- **Unique Entity Number (UEN)**: All registered business entities in Singapore, not specific to GST. Every GST-registered business has a UEN, but UEN itself is the company‚Äôs main ID, not a GST number. 
- **GST Registration number**: Any business entity that is registered for GST with IRAS. Overseas suppliers who register for GST also receive one. GST-registered suppliers are required to print their GST Registration Number on every tax invoice and receipt issued. In most cases GST registration number is the same as the UEN.

When the numbers differ, the GST registration number will be included in identities.

There are other tax IDs in Singapore like the NRIC or FIN, but they are used mainly for personal identification, and not mandated on invoices.
