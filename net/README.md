# GOBL Net

> ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** — GOBL Net is under active development. The package
> API and the wire protocol may change without notice and are not yet
> covered by any stability guarantee.

**Status:** Draft. This document is the wire-protocol specification for
GOBL Net and describes the current state of the
`github.com/invopop/gobl/net` package and related supporting code in
`dsig`. CLI commands (`gobl init`, `gobl net who/send/serve`, `gobl sign
--domain …`, `gobl verify --remote`) and the reference server live in
[`github.com/invopop/gobl.dev`](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.dev/#gobl-net) —
that README covers on-disk layout, ACME, structured logging, and the
operational stances. The protocol is pre-1.0 and subject to change.

## Abstract

GOBL Net is a decentralized identity and discovery protocol for signed GOBL
documents. It binds a document signature to a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN), and defines a small set of well-known HTTPS endpoints at that domain:

- `/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>` — a single public JWK looked up by key
  ID, used to verify signatures.
- `/.well-known/gobl/who` — a signed GOBL Envelope carrying an
  `org.Party` document, endorsing the holder's identity.
- `/.well-known/gobl/inbox` — a write endpoint that accepts signed
  envelopes addressed to the holder.

Trust in an identity is anchored to the TLS certificate for the
Address's FQDN: a signature's verifiable origin lives in its signed
`iss`, the verifier fetches the corresponding public key from
`https://<iss>/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`, and the HTTPS connection
proves the response really came from that FQDN. KYC vendors
("Authorities") are an optional endorsement layer on top of that
anchor — a participant MAY carry a vendor's countersignature, and
verifiers MAY treat that countersignature as additional evidence;
neither side is required to.

The protocol layers on top of standards already in use by GOBL:

- **RFC 7515** — JSON Web Signature, for envelope signing.
- **RFC 7517** — JSON Web Key Set, for key discovery.
- **RFC 3986** — URI syntax, for discovery transport.

GOBL Net does not define new cryptographic primitives. It defines (a) how a
GOBL signature identifies its origin, (b) how to discover the verifying
keys, (c) how to retrieve an endorsed identity for an address, and (d) how
to deliver a signed envelope to its recipient.

## 1. Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119, RFC 8174).

## 2. Terminology

- **Address** — An FQDN identifying a GOBL Net participant, e.g.
  `billing.invopop.com`. Represented in code as `net.Address`.
- **Published key** — A `dsig.PublicKey` (an RFC 7517 JWK plus the
  optional `valid_from` / `valid_until` extension members) served at
  `/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`.
- **Party Envelope** — A signed GOBL Envelope whose document is an
  `org.Party`, exchanged at the who endpoint.
- **iss / aud** — Fields in a signature's *signed payload* carrying the
  verifiable GOBL Net origin (`iss`) and the address the signature is
  bound to (`aud`), both as `gobl:` `cbc.URI` values. These are the
  authoritative, tamper-proof identities.
- **header from / to** — Optional unsigned `cbc.URI` fields on the
  envelope header expressing *intent/routing* in any scheme (`peppol:`,
  `mailto:`, `gobl:`…). Useful for interop with other formats; not used
  for verification.
- **allow-list** — Optional `<domain>/allow.json` (array of addresses)
  restricting which callers a domain accepts on `/who` and `/inbox`.

## 3. Addressing

### 3.1 Address Format

A GOBL Net Address is an FQDN. It MUST NOT contain a scheme, port, path,
query, or fragment.

Parsing is performed by `net.ParseAddress` and applies the following
normalizations and constraints:

1. Surrounding whitespace is trimmed.
2. The address is lowercased.
3. A trailing dot, if present, is stripped.
4. The result MUST satisfy `is.DNSName` (RFC 1035 label syntax).
5. The result MUST contain at least one dot (i.e. at least two labels).

Inputs that contain a scheme, port, or path MUST be rejected with
`ErrAddressInvalid`. An empty input MUST be rejected with `ErrAddressEmpty`.

**Examples.** Accepted (after normalization):

| Input                       | Parsed Address          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| `billing.invopop.com`       | `billing.invopop.com`   |
| `sub.domain.example.org`    | `sub.domain.example.org`|
| `Billing.Invopop.COM`       | `billing.invopop.com`   |
| `billing.invopop.com.`      | `billing.invopop.com`   |
| `  billing.invopop.com  `   | `billing.invopop.com`   |

Rejected:

| Input                  | Error                |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| `` (empty)             | `ErrAddressEmpty`    |
| `localhost`            | `ErrAddressInvalid` (single label) |
| `http://example.com`   | `ErrAddressInvalid` (scheme) |
| `example.com/path`     | `ErrAddressInvalid` (path)   |
| `example.com:8080`     | `ErrAddressInvalid` (port)   |
| `not valid!.com`       | `ErrAddressInvalid` (illegal characters) |

### 3.2 Well-Known Paths

The following constants are defined in `net/address.go`:

| Constant         | Value                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `WellKnownPath`  | `/.well-known/gobl`                  |
| `KeysPath`       | `/.well-known/gobl/keys` (prefix)    |
| `KeyPath(kid)`   | `/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`       |
| `WhoPath`        | `/.well-known/gobl/who`              |
| `InboxPath`      | `/.well-known/gobl/inbox`            |
| `JWKSPath`       | `/.well-known/jwks.json`             |

For an Address `A`, the canonical URI and URLs are

```
gobl:<A>                                   ← Address.URI()  (iss / aud value)
https://<A>/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>    ← KeyURL(kid)
https://<A>/.well-known/gobl/who           ← WhoURL()
https://<A>/.well-known/gobl/inbox         ← InboxURL()
https://<A>/.well-known/jwks.json          ← JWKSURL()
```

The protocol exposes two key-discovery surfaces:

1. **Per-kid** at `/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>` — single-JWK lookups,
   used by `Client.FetchKey` during verification. Scales as keys
   rotate; an absent or retired kid returns `404`.
2. **Bulk JWKS** at `/.well-known/jwks.json` — standard RFC 7517 JWK
   Set. GOBL Net signatures do **not** carry a `jku` header, so this
   endpoint is for tooling that fetches a JWK Set by convention
   (e.g. derived from the signer's domain) rather than from a JWS
   header reference.

The scheme MUST be `https`. HTTP is not a permitted alternative for
production deployments; client tooling MAY offer an opt-in for plain
HTTP solely for local development.

Responses are always JSON, so file extensions are omitted from the paths.

### 3.3 Topic Derivation

`Address.Topic()` returns the address with its labels reversed and joined
by dots: `billing.invopop.com` becomes `com.invopop.billing`. The topic
form is provided for use by notification fan-out implementations; it is
not consumed by any code in this package.

## 4. Keys

Each domain publishes one or more public keys, each individually
addressable by its `kid` at `/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`. The response
body is a single RFC 7517 JSON Web Key, optionally augmented with a
GOBL Net validity window:

```
{
  "kty": "EC", "crv": "P-256", "kid": "…", "x": "…", "y": "…",
  "valid_from":  "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "valid_until": "2027-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`valid_from` and `valid_until` are *additional JWK members* in the sense
of RFC 7517 §4 — implementations that do not recognise them MUST ignore
them, so the response remains a conformant JWK for any standard JOSE
consumer.

When set, the validity window bounds the signing time that each
signature may carry in its signed payload (`iat`). A verifier rejects
a signature whose `iat` falls outside `[valid_from, valid_until]`.
The checks degrade gracefully: an absent bound on the key, or an
absent `iat` on the signature, simply skips that half of the
comparison.

`valid_from` is stamped automatically when a key is generated.
`valid_until` is left empty and is meant to be set when the operator
rotates the key out — either at retirement, or in advance of a
planned rotation. A retired key remains published so that historical
envelopes signed within its window still verify; only signatures with
an `iat` past `valid_until` are rejected.

Verifiers MUST treat unknown kids as `404 Not Found`; this is how a
domain expresses that a key has been removed entirely (as distinct from
"retired but still serving historical verification"). The per-kid path
is the only one GOBL's own `Client.FetchKey` uses.

### 4a. Bulk JWKS endpoint (jwt.io interop)

In addition to the per-kid endpoint, the server publishes a standard
RFC 7517 JWK Set at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. This is provided as a
convenience for operators inspecting their keys via `curl` and for
third-party JOSE tooling that prefers to fetch a full key set by URL
rather than per-kid. GOBL Net's own verifier
(`Client.FetchKey` → per-kid endpoint) does not use it.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    { "kty": "EC", "kid": "<newest UUIDv7>", "valid_from": "…", … },
    { "kty": "EC", "kid": "<older  UUIDv7>", "valid_until": "…", … }
  ]
}
```

Keys are returned **newest first**, ordered by `valid_from`
descending; entries without a `valid_from` sort last. Since key IDs
are UUIDv7 (time-ordered), kid descending is the deterministic
tie-breaker.

The JOSE header on each signature carries `alg` and `kid` only. The
signed payload's `iss` value names the issuing GOBL Net address; a
verifier resolves that to the per-kid URL via `Client.FetchKey`.

The key type and the validity-window enforcement live in the `dsig`
package: a published key is a `dsig.PublicKey`. `head.Header.Verify`
calls `dsig.PublicKey.Allows` automatically, so every signed-envelope
verifier — whether through GOBL Net or a direct `Envelope.Verify` call
— enforces the window.

A conforming server MUST serve each published key verbatim at
`/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>` and the bulk set at
`/.well-known/jwks.json`. The reference implementation in
`gobl.dev`'s `gobl net serve` stores one file per `kid` on disk and
maps 1:1 to a future row-per-`kid` database — but the on-disk layout
is an implementation detail of that server, not part of this
protocol.

Endorsement of a participant happens at the identity layer (see §6) and
does *not* live inside the key material itself.

## 5. Signatures

### 5.1 Signed identities: `iss` / `aud` / `iat`

Each signature signs a payload of `{uuid, dig, iss, aud, iat}`:

- `uuid` + `dig` identify the document (immutable after signing).
- `iss` is the signer's verifiable GOBL Net address as a `gobl:` URI
  (e.g. `gobl:billing.invopop.com`). The verifier reads it to
  discover *which* per-key endpoint to fetch.
- `aud` is the optional GOBL Net address the signature is bound to. When
  present, the recipient checks `aud == self` to reject misrouted or
  replayed envelopes.
- `iat` is the signing time as a JWT-standard NumericDate (Unix
  seconds, per RFC 7519 §2). It is set automatically by `Sign`;
  verifiers read it for the per-key validity window check but no
  freshness policy is enforced by default — receivers may apply their
  own max-age window when relevant.

Because `iss`/`aud`/`iat` are inside the signed payload, the origin,
audience, and signing time are all tamper-proof. Multiple parties may
countersign the same document (shared `uuid`+`dig`) each with their own
`iss`/`aud`/`iat`.

The header `from`/`to` (`cbc.URI`) are a *separate*, unsigned layer for
intent/routing in any scheme; they are never used for verification.

### 5.2 Envelope Signing

`Envelope.Sign(key, iss, aud)` (→ `head.Header.Sign`) signs the document
identity plus the signer's `iss` and optional `aud`. Both may be empty
for a plain, non-GOBL-Net signature.

## 6. Verification

### 6.1 Envelope Verification Flow

`Client.VerifyEnvelope(ctx, env, expectedAud)` returns the verified
issuer address:

1. The envelope MUST be signed; otherwise `ErrVerifyFailed`.
2. The first signature's signed payload is read; `iss` MUST be a `gobl:`
   URI (else `ErrVerifyFailed`).
3. `FetchKey(ctx, iss-host, kid)` fetches the issuer's published key
   from `/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>` (including its optional
   `valid_from` / `valid_until`).
4. The envelope is verified against that public key.
5. If `expectedAud` is non-empty, the signed `aud` MUST equal it.
6. If the key declares a validity window, the signed `iat` MUST fall
   within `[valid_from, valid_until]` (each bound optional).
7. The verified issuer address is returned.

### 6.2 Identity exchange (`/who`)

`/who` is an authenticated, mutual exchange (see §8.2). The caller POSTs
a signed envelope (`iss=gobl:caller`, `aud=gobl:target`, document = the
caller's `org.Party`); the target verifies it, applies its allow-list,
and responds with its own party envelope signed `iss=gobl:target`,
`aud=gobl:caller`. A conforming client performs the exchange and
verifies the response is signed by the target and bound to the
caller.

### 6.3 Trusted Authorities (optional)

The package-level slice `net.Authorities` holds GOBL Net addresses
treated as trusted KYC vendors. The default list is empty;
`net.RegisterAuthority` or the `WithAuthorities` client option add to
it. The list is an opt-in policy hook for verifiers that want to
require an authority countersignature on a `/who` response — no
endpoint *requires* it, no envelope verification path consults it
automatically, and the protocol's trust anchor (§11.1) does not
depend on it.

## 7. Discovery Transport

### 7.1 HTTP Client Defaults

The default `HTTPFetcher` enforces:

| Parameter             | Value              |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Request timeout       | 10 seconds         |
| Maximum response size | 1 MiB              |
| Required `Accept`     | `application/json` |
| Required scheme       | `https`            |
| Required status       | `200 OK`           |

Responses larger than 1 MiB are truncated. Any non-200 response causes
`ErrFetchFailed`.

### 7.2 Pluggable Fetcher

The `Fetcher` interface (`Fetch(ctx, url) ([]byte, error)`) allows
substituting the HTTP transport, e.g. for testing, in-process resolution,
or alternative transports. Use `net.WithFetcher(f)` when constructing a
`Client`.

## 8. Server-Side Endpoints

### 8.1 `GET /.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`

Open. Returns a single RFC 7517 JSON Web Key as `application/json` —
the file `<domain>/keys/<kid>.json`, optionally carrying GOBL Net's
`valid_from` / `valid_until` extension members (see §4). Unknown kid
returns `404 Not Found`. No bulk endpoint is exposed.

### 8.2 `POST /.well-known/gobl/who`

Authenticated party exchange. The caller POSTs a signed envelope
(`iss=gobl:caller`, `aud=gobl:self`, document = the caller's
`org.Party`). The server verifies the signature against the caller's
published key (fetched from the caller's per-kid endpoint), requires
`aud == self`, and applies the allow-list to `iss`. It responds `200`
with its own party envelope signed
`iss=gobl:self`, `aud=gobl:caller`.

| Status            | Cause                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `200 OK`          | Verified; returns the signed party envelope.       |
| `400 Bad Request` | Body did not decode as an envelope.                |
| `401 Unauthorized`| Signature/issuer/audience verification failed.     |
| `403 Forbidden`   | Caller (`iss`) not on the domain's allow-list.     |

### 8.3 `POST /.well-known/gobl/inbox`

Accepts a signed GOBL Envelope. The signer (`iss`) is verified against
its published key (fetched from `<iss>/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`);
if the envelope carries an `aud` it MUST equal this inbox; the
allow-list (if present) is applied to `iss`. Status codes:

| Status                       | Cause                                                |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `202 Accepted`               | Envelope parsed, validated, signature verified, persisted. |
| `400 Bad Request`            | Body could not be read or did not decode as JSON.    |
| `401 Unauthorized`           | Envelope signature did not verify.                   |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity`   | Envelope failed structural validation.               |
| `500 Internal Server Error`  | Persistence failed.                                  |

The request body size is capped at 1 MiB. On 202 the envelope is written
to the configured inbox directory under `<envelope-uuid>.json`.

In this release the server does not return a signed receipt on 202; the
response body is empty. A future `net.Response` type may carry an
acknowledgement body.

## 9. Reference Implementation

GOBL Net's reference client lives in this package (`net.Client`,
`net.Address`, `net.Authorities`). The reference server and the
operator-facing CLI (`gobl init`, `gobl net who/send/serve`,
`gobl sign --domain …`, `gobl verify --remote`) live in
[`gobl.dev`](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.dev/#gobl-net), which also
documents the server's on-disk layout, ACME setup, multi-tenant
routing, structured logging, and Docker deployment.

The protocol is transport-defined; any conforming implementation can
serve the well-known endpoints from §8 over HTTPS.

## 10. Errors

The package exports the following sentinel errors:

| Error                  | Cause                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ErrAddressEmpty`      | Empty input to `ParseAddress`.                                   |
| `ErrAddressInvalid`    | Input is not a valid FQDN per §3.1.                              |
| `ErrFetchFailed`       | Well-known resource fetch failed (network, non-200, malformed).  |
| `ErrVerifyFailed`      | Envelope verification failed (no signature, non-`gobl:` `iss`, key fetch failed, signature mismatch, `aud` mismatch, `iat` outside the key's validity window). |
| `ErrUnknownAuthority`  | An endorser on a `/who` envelope is not in `Authorities` (only raised by callers that opt into authority enforcement). |
| `ErrPartyMissing`      | A `/who` response did not contain an `org.Party` document.       |
| `ErrInboxRejected`     | A receiving inbox did not return 202.                            |

All callers using `errors.Is` against these sentinels MUST continue to
work after wrapping with `fmt.Errorf("%w: ...", err)`.

## 11. Security Considerations

### 11.1 Trust Model

A signature's verifiable origin is the signed `iss` URI. Verification
fetches the public key from
`https://<iss-fqdn>/.well-known/gobl/keys/<kid>`, and the HTTPS
connection's certificate proves the response really came from that
FQDN. The trust anchor is therefore the Web PKI binding of the
Address to the entity that controls its TLS certificate.

A forged `iss` pointing to an attacker-controlled host can only
produce a signature that verifies against an attacker-controlled key
served from that host — distinguishable from the expected identity
at the application layer. Callers that already know the expected
Address SHOULD pass it as `expectedAud` to `Client.VerifyEnvelope`,
or compare the returned issuer Address against an allow-list before
acting on the document.

### 11.2 TLS

All well-known endpoints are served over HTTPS in production. Verifiers
rely on the host's TLS certificate to establish that the served content
originates from the named Address. Operators MUST ensure that TLS
certificate issuance is properly controlled for any Address they intend
to use as an identity.

### 11.3 Authority Trust

`Authorities` is an opt-in allowlist of FQDNs (see §6.3). For
verifiers that *do* enforce it, the threat is symmetrical to §11.1
but multiplied: an attacker who gains the ability to issue a TLS
certificate for any address in `Authorities` can serve a forged
`/who` for any participant whose envelopes the verifier accepts on
the strength of that authority's countersignature. Where this hook
is used, the KYC vendor list MUST be kept short and reviewed
regularly.

### 11.4 Inbox Authentication

The inbox endpoint verifies the sender's signature before persisting an
envelope, but does *not* require the sender to be a known
KYC-endorsed participant. Operators that need to restrict inbox
acceptance to known correspondents MUST apply additional filtering —
typically a per-domain `allow.json` (see §2) gating `iss`, or an
application-level `/who` exchange against the sender's address before
acting on the document.

### 11.5 Response Size

The 1 MiB cap on Key, Who, and inbox bodies limits memory amplification
from hostile or misconfigured peers.

### 11.6 Address Canonicalization

`ParseAddress` lowercases and strips trailing dots before validation, so
two visually distinct strings such as `Example.COM.` and `example.com`
normalize to the same Address. Callers MUST use `ParseAddress` (directly
or via `Address.Validate`) before comparing addresses for equality.
