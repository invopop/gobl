    "en": "The United States does not have a federal value-added tax (VAT) or goods and\nservices tax (GST). Instead, sales taxes are levied at the state and local\nlevel, with rates and rules varying significantly across jurisdictions.\n\nSales tax rates range from 0% in states with no sales tax (e.g. Oregon,\nMontana, Delaware, New Hampshire) to combined state and local rates exceeding\n10% in some areas. Sales tax is generally collected by the seller at the point\nof sale and remitted to the relevant state tax authority.\n\nBusinesses are identified by their EIN (Employer Identification Number), a\n9-digit number assigned by the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) in the format\nXX-XXXXXXX. State-level tax registration is separate and varies by\njurisdiction.\n\nThere is no federal e-invoicing mandate. Both credit notes and debit notes\nare supported for invoice corrections."
